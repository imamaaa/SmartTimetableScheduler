# Automated Timetable Generator

## Project Overview
The **Automated Timetable Generator** is an intelligent scheduling tool designed to streamline course scheduling for academic institutions. It ensures clash-free timetable creation by providing an interactive drag-and-drop interface for administrators to assign courses to available timeslots. The system proactively detects scheduling conflicts for students and instructors, reducing administrative workload and improving scheduling efficiency.

## Problem Statement
Manually generating a timetable for a university is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Coordinators must ensure that no student or instructor has overlapping classes while also managing room availability and course assignments. The process often leads to inefficiencies, last-minute adjustments, and scheduling conflicts, affecting students' learning experience and faculty workload.

## Target Audience
- **University administrators** responsible for scheduling courses.
- **Faculty members** who need efficient and fair scheduling.
- **Students** who benefit from conflict-free timetables.

## Key Features

### 1. Course and Instructor Management
- Predefined courses assigned to specific instructors.
- Hardcoded section assignments for each course.

### 2. Student Enrollment and Clash Detection
- Students are pre-enrolled in specific courses.
- System detects clashes for students and instructors and provides real-time alerts.

### 3. Timeslot Generation
- Administrators define available time slots and durations for a 5-day schedule.
- Courses are assigned to slots using a drag-and-drop interface.

### 4. Conflict Resolution and Notifications
- The system flags conflicts when a student is enrolled in overlapping courses.
- Displays affected studentsâ€™ roll numbers for easy resolution.
- Highlights instructor clashes for better decision-making.

### 5. Room Allocation
- Courses are assigned to specific rooms within predefined buildings.
- Ensures optimal room utilization and minimizes scheduling errors.

## Expected Impact
By automating timetable creation, this project significantly reduces human errors, optimizes scheduling time, and enhances the overall academic experience. The system ensures fairness in scheduling and provides transparency for all stakeholders involved.
